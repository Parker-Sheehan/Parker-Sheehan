### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Parker Sheehan,
a full-stack developer who's been refining my craft since 2022. At the beginning of 2023, I embarked on a journey of taking coding more seriously by enrolling in a programming bootcamp. There, I cultivated a passion for problem-solving and complex thought processes.

Upon graduation from the bootcamp, I was hand picked to join the educational staff, where I had the incredible opportunity to help others like me acquire the same skills that have fueled my imagination with innovative ideas. Recently I've addopted the mantra of how you do anything is how you do everything, I'm a firm believer of having no technical debt in code or in life. Taking care of that 15 minute problem right now will save hours in the future.

I thrive on diving into unfamiliar territories and teaching myself new technologies. Whether it's experimenting with cutting-edge frameworks or exploring the latest industry trends, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and push the boundaries of what's possible. Let's connect and collaborate on bringing exciting ideas to life!
