- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Parker Sheehan, a full-stack developer who's been refining my craft since 2022. At the beginning of 2023, I embarked on an exciting journey by enrolling in a programming bootcamp. There, I cultivated a passion for problem-solving and creating amazing user experiences. ðŸš€

Upon graduation from the bootcamp, I was hand picked to join the educational staff, where I had the incredible opportunity to help others like me acquire the same skills that have fueled my imagination with innovative ideas. ðŸ’¡

I thrive on diving into unfamiliar territories and teaching myself new technologies. Whether it's experimenting with cutting-edge frameworks or exploring the latest industry trends, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and push the boundaries of what's possible. Let's connect and collaborate on bringing exciting ideas to life!
